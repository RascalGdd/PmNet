## General Surgical Workflow Recognition

### Prepare your data
Download raw video data from [PmLR50](link);
The final structure of datasets should be as following:

Note that you can change `fps` in the Step.2 to generate more frames.
```bash
data/
    â””â”€â”€PmLR50/
        â””â”€â”€frames/
            â””â”€â”€01
                â”œâ”€â”€00000.png
                â”œâ”€â”€00001.png
                â””â”€â”€...
            â”œâ”€â”€...    
            â””â”€â”€50
        â””â”€â”€labels_pkl/
            â””â”€â”€train
            â”œâ”€â”€val
            â””â”€â”€test
```
### Training
We provide the script for training [train_phase.sh](https://github.com/RascalGdd/PmNet/blob/main/train_phase.sh).

run the following code for training

```shell
sh scripts/train.sh
```
> You need to modify **data_path**, **eval_data_path**, **output_dir** and **log_dir** according to your own setting.

### Test
> Currently, the test and evaluation codes we provide are only applicable to two-GPU inference.

1. run the following code for testing, and get **0.txt** and **1.txt**;

```shell
sh scripts/test.sh
```
